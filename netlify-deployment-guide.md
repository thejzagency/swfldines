# 🚀 Deploy SW Florida Dines to swfldines.com

## Your Files Are Ready! ✅

I've built your production files. Here's how to get them to Netlify:

## 📁 **Files You Need to Upload:**

All files inside the `dist` folder:
- `index.html` (main website file)
- `assets/` folder (contains CSS and JavaScript)
- `_redirects` (makes your single-page app work properly)

## 🌐 **Netlify Upload Steps:**

### **Step 1: Go to Netlify**
1. Visit **[netlify.com](https://netlify.com)**
2. Sign up or log in
3. Click **"Add new site"**
4. Click **"Deploy manually"** (not from Git)

### **Step 2: Upload Your Files**
Since you're in a web environment, you'll need to:

1. **Right-click on the `dist` folder** in your file explorer (left sidebar)
2. **Look for "Download" or "Export"** option
3. **If no download option:** Try right-clicking individual files:
   - Right-click `index.html` → Download
   - Right-click `_redirects` → Download
   - Right-click the `assets` folder → Download

### **Step 3: Alternative - Use Bolt Hosting**
If downloading is difficult, I can deploy directly to Bolt's hosting service and you can:
1. **Get a live URL immediately**
2. **Point your swfldines.com domain** to that URL
3. **Have your restaurant directory live** within minutes

## 🎯 **Which Option Would You Prefer?**

**Option A:** Try downloading the files and uploading to Netlify
**Option B:** Deploy to Bolt Hosting and point your domain there

Both will get your restaurant directory live at **swfldines.com**!
