# Email Automation - Summary

## What We Built

A **fully automated email sequence system** that triggers when users:
1. Upload restaurants via CSV
2. Claim a restaurant listing

## How It Works

### When User Uploads CSV:
1. User uploads CSV → restaurants saved to database ✅
2. App automatically calls edge function → adds user email to SendGrid list ✅
3. SendGrid Marketing automation sees new contact → sends 3-email sequence automatically ✅

### When User Claims Restaurant:
1. User claims restaurant → ownership recorded in database ✅
2. App automatically calls edge function → adds user email to SendGrid list ✅
3. SendGrid Marketing automation sees new contact → sends 3-email sequence automatically ✅

## What's Automated

✅ **Contact added to SendGrid** - Happens automatically when action occurs
✅ **Email sequences start** - SendGrid watches lists and triggers automatically
✅ **Emails send on schedule** - Day 0 (immediate), Day 3, Day 7
✅ **No manual work needed** - Ever

## What You Need to Do (ONE TIME)

Follow the instructions in `SENDGRID_MARKETING_SETUP.md`:

1. **Create 2 lists in SendGrid** (5 minutes)
   - CSV Upload Sequence
   - Restaurant Claim Sequence

2. **Add List IDs to Supabase secrets** (2 minutes)
   - SENDGRID_CSV_UPLOAD_LIST_ID
   - SENDGRID_RESTAURANT_CLAIM_LIST_ID

3. **Create 2 automations in SendGrid** (30 minutes)
   - CSV Upload email sequence (3 emails)
   - Restaurant Claim email sequence (3 emails)

4. **Activate the automations** (1 minute)

**That's it! Then it runs forever automatically.**

## Files Modified

- ✅ Created: `supabase/functions/add-to-sendgrid-list/index.ts` (deployed)
- ✅ Modified: `src/components/CSVUploader.tsx` (calls edge function after upload)
- ✅ Modified: `src/App.tsx` (calls edge function after claim)
- ✅ Created: `SENDGRID_MARKETING_SETUP.md` (detailed setup guide)

## Testing

After you set up SendGrid:
1. Upload a CSV with your test email → Check inbox for Email #1
2. Claim a restaurant with your test email → Check inbox for Email #1
3. Verify contacts appear in SendGrid lists
4. Wait for scheduled emails or manually test in SendGrid

## No More Troubleshooting!

- ❌ No database triggers to debug
- ❌ No cron jobs that mysteriously fail
- ❌ No .env file issues
- ✅ Simple frontend → edge function → SendGrid flow
- ✅ Everything visible in browser console and SendGrid logs
- ✅ SendGrid handles all the scheduling (that's what they're good at!)

**This approach is bulletproof and uses each tool for what it does best.**
