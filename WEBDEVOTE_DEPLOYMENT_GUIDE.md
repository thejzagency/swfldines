# 🚀 Deploy SW Florida Dines to WebDevote Hosting

## Perfect Choice! ✅

Since you already have:
- ✅ **swfldines.com domain** managed through WebDevote
- ✅ **SendGrid integration** configured in WebDevote panel
- ✅ **DNS and email** already working

It makes perfect sense to deploy your restaurant directory to WebDevote rather than starting over elsewhere.

## 📦 **Step 1: Your Files Are Ready**

I've built your production files. You need to upload everything from the `dist` folder:
- `index.html` (main website file)
- `assets/` folder (contains CSS and JavaScript)
- `_redirects` (makes your single-page app work properly)

## 🌐 **Step 2: Access WebDevote Control Panel**

1. **Login to your WebDevote account**
2. **Find the control panel** for swfldines.com
3. **Look for "File Manager" or "Upload Files"** section

## 📁 **Step 3: Upload Your Files**

### **Method A: File Manager Upload**
1. **Open File Manager** in WebDevote control panel
2. **Navigate to your domain's public folder** (usually `public_html` or `www`)
3. **Delete any existing files** in that folder (if any)
4. **Upload ALL files from your `dist` folder:**
   - Upload `index.html`
   - Upload the entire `assets` folder
   - Upload `_redirects` file

### **Method B: FTP Upload (if available)**
1. **Get FTP credentials** from WebDevote
2. **Use an FTP client** like FileZilla
3. **Upload all `dist` folder contents** to the public folder

## ⚙️ **Step 4: Configure Environment Variables**

In your WebDevote control panel, look for:
- **"Environment Variables"**
- **"PHP Settings"** 
- **"Application Settings"**
- **"Configuration"**

Add these variables:
```bash
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_existing_sendgrid_key_from_webdevote
SITE_URL=https://swfldines.com
```

## 🔧 **Step 5: Update Supabase Settings**

Once your site is live at swfldines.com:

1. **Go to Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Settings**
2. **Update Site URL to:** `https://swfldines.com`
3. **Update Redirect URLs to:** `https://swfldines.com/**`

## ✅ **Step 6: Test Everything**

After deployment:
1. **Visit swfldines.com** - Should show your restaurant directory
2. **Test user signup** - Should work with email confirmation
3. **Login as admin** - Should access admin dashboard
4. **Test email system** - Should use your existing SendGrid setup

## 💡 **Advantages of Using WebDevote:**

- ✅ **Keep existing SendGrid setup** - No need to reconfigure emails
- ✅ **Domain already configured** - DNS is already pointing correctly
- ✅ **Familiar control panel** - You already know how to use it
- ✅ **Professional email delivery** - Your existing setup keeps working
- ✅ **No migration headaches** - Everything stays in one place

## 🚨 **If You Need Help:**

1. **Can't find File Manager?** Look for "cPanel", "Control Panel", or "Website Files"
2. **Upload issues?** Try uploading files one at a time instead of all at once
3. **Environment variables not available?** Contact WebDevote support - they can help set them up

## 📞 **WebDevote Support:**

If you need help with the upload process, WebDevote support can:
- Show you exactly where to upload files
- Help configure environment variables
- Ensure your domain points to the right folder

**This is definitely the smart approach - keep everything in one place where it's already working!** 🌴
